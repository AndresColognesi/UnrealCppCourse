# Abstract

This repo contains some materials from and developed for the "C++ Programming for Unreal Game Development" specialization from the University of Colorado System (through Coursera).

---

# Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 with proper C++ and Unreal Engine pugins installed.
- Unreal Engine version `5.3`.

---

# Content Structure

The `/Art` folder contains 3D assets made availble and used throughout the specialization.

The folders within `/CourseX`, where X is 1, 2, 3 or 4; are Unreal projects developed for each course (as part of the optional exercises, but the most useful content). There are mostly Unreal Engine 5.3 projects, but some are still UE4 as provided by the course. So a conversion will be necessary to open it up on later engine versions.

The `/CppCodingExercises` folder contains some practice C++ exercises developed during the course.

The `SomeCourseAssignments` contains C++ code (or complete Visual Studio projects) developed for some programming assignments for the course. **Don't use them as your own submission if you are taking the course!**
